#GetResponse API

version 1.22.0, 2013-01-04 [changelog](#changelog)

##GETTING STARTED

####Authentication

![API KEY](https://app.getresponse.com/images/core/dashboard-icons/use-getresponse-api.png)

In order to use GetResponse API the API KEY is required.

* GetResponse users can obtain it from [my account](https://app.getresponse.com/my_api_key.html) section after logging to your GetResponse account.
* GetResponse360 users should login to server with owner privileges and visit "My account" → "Use GetResponse API".

**Warning**: Please note that the API KEY unambiguously identifies your account and allows all who know the API KEY to manage contacts, messages etc. Please keep your API KEY safe and do not share it with any unauthorized persons.

---

####Protocol

GetResponse API is [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/) based and supports both 1.0 and 2.0 (with Notifications and Batches) specifications.

**Warning**: 1.1 draft specification support will be dropped by the end of the year, please adjust your code/libraries to use official 1.0 or 2.0 specification.

**Warning**: If you're receiving **HTTP "204 No content"** response check if `id` member is present in your Requests. Lack of this member means that the Request is a Notification - signifies the Clients lack of interest in receiving Response as explained [here](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#notification). Our API supports Notification requests since November 30th. If your integration due to lack of `id` member requested this functionality by mistake then don't worry because all Notification Requests were processed by our servers. If you used for example add_contact() method those subscriptions are not lost.

**Note**: We support SSL and gzipped transfer (over 1KB).

---

####Location

* GetResponse users should use `http://api2.getresponse.com` URL.
* GetResponse360 users have unique URL and it will be provided to them by Account Manager.

    }
```

Array `flags` may be present with following items:<a name="message_flags"/>

* `clicktrack` – Clicks on links in message are counted.  Note that for the link to be click-tracked it must be also wrapped in [GetResponse Dynamic Content](https://github.com/GetResponse/DevZone/tree/master/DC#clicktracked_links) `{{LINK}}` tag. This behaves differently than web interface, where (for simplicity) all links are click-tracked when click-track checkbox is set.
* `subscription_reminder` – Short disclaimer is added to the message content to make sure that subscriber know why they are receiving the messages.
* `openrate` – Opened messages are counted (only if html content is present).
* `google_analytics` – Google Analytics code is appended to every link in message.

**Hint**: All merge-words in subject are returned as [GetResponse Dynamic Content](https://github.com/GetResponse/DevZone/tree/master/DC) syntax.

**Hint**: If type is follow-up then `day_of_cycle` is returned and if type is newsletter then `send_on` is returned. Those fields are not present in drafts.

**Hint**: If you need plain and HTML contents of your message use [get_message_contents](#get_message_contents) method.

####send_newsletter<a name="send_newsletter"/>

            "from_field"        : "FROM_FIELD_ID",

                "name" : "people.csv",
                "mime" : "application/csv"
                },
            ],
            "flags" : [ "clicktrack", "openrate" ],
            "contacts"          : [ "CONTACT_ID", "CONTACT_ID" ],

            "get_suppressions"  : { get_suppressions conditions }

        }
    ]
```

Conditions:

* `campaign` (mandatory) – `CAMPAIGN_ID` obtained from [get_campaigns](#get_campaigns). Newsletter will be saved in this campaign. Note that it is not the same as selecting contacts – check `contacts` / `get_contacts` params for that.
* `from_field` (optional) – `FROM_FIELD_ID` obtained from [get_account_from_fields](#get_account_from_fields). It represents From header (name and email) in message and will be taken from campaign if not given.
* `reply_to_field` (optional) – `FROM_FIELD_ID` obtained from [get_account_from_fields](#get_account_from_fields). It represents Reply-To header (email) in message and will not be present if not given.
* `subject` (mandatory) – Subject value. All merge-words should be written as [GetResponse Dynamic Content](https://github.com/GetResponse/DevZone/tree/master/DC) syntax. Maximum length is 512 characters.
* `contents` (mandatory) – Allowed keys are `plain` and `html`, at least one is mandatory. All merge-words should be written as [GetResponse Dynamic Content](https://github.com/GetResponse/DevZone/tree/master/DC) syntax. Maximum length is 524288 characters each.
* `attachments` (optional) - Files that will be attached to message. Field `data` must be encoded using [Base64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) algorithm. Filed `name` represents name of file. Field `mime` represents [media type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type) of file.
* `flags` (optional) – Enables extra functionality for a message, see [message_flags](#message_flags) for available values.
* `contacts` / `get_contacts` or `segments` / `get_segments` - Recipients that should receive a newsletter obtained from [get_contacts](#get_contacts) or [get_segments](#get_segments). Only one type of selection can be used at a time. See [IDs in conditions](#ids) for detailed explanation.
* `suppressions` / `get_suppressions` (optional) – Suppressions to use with that message. Any contact email address that matches any of the masks in those suppressions will be skipped when sending. See [IDs in conditions](#ids) for detailed explanation.

_JSON result:_

```json
    {
        "MESSAGE_ID"    : "abc123",
        "queued"        : 1,
        "contacts"      : 1024,
        "segments"      : 4
    }
```

Where:

* `contacts` - Represents the number of unique email addresses that are set to receive this newsletter chosen by `contacts` or `get_contacts` conditions. Presence of contact on suppressions / blacklists does not affect this counter. 
* `segments` - Represents the number of unique segments that are set to receive this newsletter chosen by `segments` or `get_segments` conditions. Segments are evaluated when message is sent, therefore amount of contacts is unknown during API call.

Those counters are mutually exclusive - only one is present depending on how recipients were chosen.

_JSON error messages (if any):_ `Missing campaign`, `Missing From field`, `Missing Reply-To field`, `Missing contents`, `Missing recipients`, `Cannot mix contact and segment recipients`, `Dynamic Content syntax error`, `Daily limit of newsletters exceeded`.

**Hint**: You don’t have to worry about duplicates when sending to multiple campaigns. If the same email exists in my_campaign_1 and my_campaign_2 campaigns then newsletter will be sent only once to this address (chosen randomly).

**Warning**: You can send 256 newsletters daily. Common mistake is to call API in the following manner:

```json
    [
        "API_KEY",
        {
            "subject" : "Hi John",
            ...
            "contacts" : [ "CONTACT_ID" ],
        }
    ]
```

and again…

```json
    [
        "API_KEY",
        {
            "subject" : "Hi Jessica",
            ...
            "contacts" : [ "CONTACT_ID" ],
        }
    ]
```

and again…

```json
    [
        "API_KEY",
        {
            "subject" : "Hi Bruce",
            ...
            "contacts" : [ "CONTACT_ID" ],
        }
    ]
```

If you iterate through your contact list and personalize every call then you’re doing it wrong! It can be compared to sending a group of passengers from city A to B, but every passenger travels in his own train.
Correct way of sending personalized content is to use [GetResponse Dynamic Content](https://github.com/GetResponse/DevZone/tree/master/DC#campaign_or_contact_or_message_info) syntax for campaign or contact or message info and then send newsletter once to a group of people:

```json
    [
        "API_KEY",
        {
            "subject" : "Hi {{CONTACT \"subscriber_first_name\"}}",
            ...
            "contacts" : [ "CONTACT_ID", "CONTACT_ID", "CONTACT_ID" ],
        }
    ]
```

**Hint**: You can check status of newsletter using [get_newsletter_statuses](#get_newsletter_statuses) method.

            }
        }
    ]
```

Conditions:

* `campaigns` / `get_campaigns` (optional) – Search only in given campaigns. Uses OR logic. If those params are not given, search is performed in all campaigns within the account. Check [IDs in conditions](#ids) for detailed explanation.
* `name` (optional) – Use [text operators](#operators) to narrow down search results to specific contact names.
* `email` (optional) – Use [text operators](#operators) to narrow down search results to specific contact emails.
* `created_on` (optional) – Use [time operators](#operators) to narrow down search results to specific contact creation date. Multiple operators are allowed and logic AND is used so date range can also be expressed.
* `origin` (optional) – Narrow down search results by contacts’ origin (subscription method). Allowed values are `import`, `email`, `www`, `panel`, `leads`, `sale`, `api`, `forward`, `survey`, `iphone`, `copy`.
* `cycle_day` (optional) – Use [numeric operators](#operators) to narrow down search results to specific  days of the followup cycles assigned to the contacts. To find contacts that already got day 2 message you have to use `{ "GREATER" : 2 }` as they have already reached that day. To find inactive contacts pass `{ "EQUALS" : null }` condition.
* `customs` (optional) – Use [text operators](#operators) to narrow down search results to contacts having specific customs. Uses AND logic. Note that if you need OR logic you can use MATCHES operator and use alternative in regular expression. Contacts that don’t have a custom of given name are not returned in results. If custom is multi-value then “any” junction is used: condition is true if any custom value tests true according to the operator used.
* `geo` (optional) – Use operators to narrow down search results to specific contact geo location. Precisely [text operators](#operators) are allowed for country, country_code, city, [numeric operators](#operators) are allowed for latitude and longitude (values are decimal numbers, like -54.5). Uses AND logic. Contacts that don’t have a geo location data are not returned in results.
* `clicks` / `get_clicks` (optional) – Use to narrow down search results to the contacts that clicked specific links. Uses AND logic. See [IDs in conditions](#ids) for detailed explanation.
* `opens` / `get_opens` (optional) – Use to narrow down search results to contacts that opened specific messages. Uses AND logic. See [IDs in conditions](#ids) for detailed explanation.
* `goals` / `get_goals` (optional) – Use to narrow down search results to contacts that reached specific goals. Uses AND logic. See [IDs in conditions](#ids) for detailed explanation.
* `segmentation` (optional) – Allows to fetch big results in smaller packs. Split value defines the number of packs to which contacts will be split. Group defines which pack will be returned in results. For example to get all results in 10 packs call [get_contacts](#get_contacts) 10 times. Set split to 10 and increase pack from 1 to 10.

_JSON result:_

```json
    {
        "CONTACT_ID" : {
            "campaign"      : "CAMPAIGN_ID",
            "name"          : "My Contact Name",
            "email"         : "my_contact_1@emailaddress.com"
            "origin"        : "www",
            "ip"            : "1.1.1.1",
            "cycle_day"     : 32,
            "created_on"    : "2010-01-01 00:00:00"
        },
        "CONTACT_ID" : {
            "campaign"      : "CAMPAIGN_ID",
            "name"          : "My Contact Name",
            "email"         : "my_contact_2@emailaddress.com"
            "origin"        : "api",
            "ip"            : "1.1.1.1",
            "cycle_day"     : null,
            "created_on"    : "2010-01-01 00:00:00"
        }
```

**Warning**: Email is unique within a campaign, but if search is performed on multiple campaigns, one email address may occur multiple times in results.

**Hint**: Segmentation does not work as pager (LIMIT x, OFFSET y behavior in SQL) and packs are “almost equal”. That means if you perform split = 10 on result that has 1000 contacts, you will get packs containing about 100 contacts. But segmentation has two very important properties that LIMIT x, OFFSET y approach doesn’t have:

* Contacts stay in their packs forever. Contact once found in the pack 23/100 will always be located in it no matter if the list was altered. This property can be used for shard-oriented synchronization.
* Packs don’t overlap. The sum of contacts in packs 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3 is the same as in search without segmentation. This property is important if you want to parallelize operation on contacts.

```json
    [
        "API_KEY",

_JSON result:_

```json
    {
        "updated"   : 2,
        "added"     : 1,
        "deleted"   : 1
    }
```

_JSON error messages (if any):_ `Missing contact`.

**Hint**: One custom name may appear multiple times in case of multi-value customs (custom must be defined as multi-value on web interface). In this case new content will be added to existing custom instead of replacing previous one.

**Hint**: If you want to remove every existing content value for multi-value customs then pass null as `content` at the beginning of method call:

```json
    "customs" : [
        {
            "name"       : "name_1_value",
            "content"    : null
        },
        {
            "name"       : "name_1_value",
            "content"    : "content_1_1_value"
        },
        {
            "name"       : "name_1_value",
            "content"    : "content_1_2_value"
        },
    ]
```
    
This will clear all content values of multi-value custom and set two new ones.

**Warning**: Custom will be silently skipped if it’s multi-value and its content is not in set of allowed values declared on web interface.

**Warning**: Custom will be silently skipped if its content does not match type declared on web interface.

        	"created_on"	: "2012-11-11 12:54:01"
    	}
	}
```

Questions that do not have predetermined answers (text fields) have response returned as string while questions with predetermined answers (single/multi selects) have array of selected options returned.

Meaning of every `QUESTION_ID` and `OPTION_ID` can be found by calling [get_survey](#get_survey) method with given `SURVEY_ID`.

**Hint**: If you want to keep surveys synchronized with external database, then setting survey [callback](https://github.com/GetResponse/DevZone/tree/master/Callback/README.md) is much more efficient than querying this method periodically.

####set_contact_cycle<a name="set_contact_cycle"/>

Place a contact on a desired day of the follow-up cycle or deactivate a contact.

_JSON params:_

```json
    [
        "API_KEY",
        {
            "contact"   : "CONTACT_ID",
            "cycle_day" : 4
        }
    ]
```

Conditions:

* `contact` (mandatory) – `CONTACT_ID`.
* `cycle_day` (mandatory) – New value of cycle day, must be in the range of 0..10000. If cycle_day is null it deactivates contact.

_JSON result:_

```json
    {
        "updated"   : 1
    }
```

_JSON error messages (if any):_ `Missing contact`.

**Warning**: Do not confuse the day of cycle with position in cycle. For example if a follow-up cycle has messages set to days 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and you set cycle_day = 4 then a contact will get message from day 4 and not message from day 8 because it’s 4th in a row.

---

####add_contact<a name="add_contact"/>

Add contact to the list.

_JSON params:_

```json

        }
    ]
```

Conditions:

* `campaign` (mandatory) – `CAMPAIGN_ID` obtained from [get_campaigns](#get_campaigns).
* `action` (optional) – Allowed modes are `standard`, `insert`, `update`. If standard mode is chosen then a new contact will be added if not already present in a given campaign otherwise existing contact will be updated including name change and customs list merge. If insert mode is chosen then a contact will be added if it doesn’t exist in a given campaign but no updates will be performed otherwise. If update is chosen then a contact will be updated if it exists in a given campaign but no inserts will be performed otherwise. Default is standard.
* `name` (optional) – Name value.
* `email` (mandatory) – Email value.
* `cycle_day` (optional) – Insert contact on a given day at the follow-up cycle. Value of 0 means the beginning of the cycle. Lack of this param means that a contact will not be inserted into cycle.
* `ip` (optional) – Contact’s IP address used for geo location. Must be given in dotted decimal format.
* `customs` (optional) – List of contact customs. In case of contact update new customs will be inserted and the existing ones will be updated with the new values. Customs not provided on this list will not be removed. Custom name must be composed using lowercase letters, digits and underscores only.

_JSON result:_

```json
    {
        "queued" : 1
    }
```

_JSON error messages (if any):_ `Invalid email syntax`, `Missing campaign`, `Contact already queued for target campaign`.

**Warning**: Adding contact is not an instant action. It will appear on your list after validation or after validation and confirmation (in case of double-optin procedure). You can set subscribe [callback](https://github.com/GetResponse/DevZone/tree/master/Callback/README.md) to be notified about successful adding.

**Hint**: It is legal to add a contact already existing in the campaign (check action param for more details) but it is illegal to have the same email added to queue twice.

**Warning**: If a contact was added and removed multiple times from the same campaign it is presented only once in results with newest deleted_on date.

**Hint**: Possible reasons are: unsubscribe, user, support, automation, complaint, blacklisted, api, bounce, other.

**Warning**: Unsubscribe link allows contact to unsubscribe from multiple campaigns, even if message was not sent from those campaigns or to contact in those campaigns.

**Hint**: If you want to keep unsubscribes synchronized with external database, then setting unsubscribe [callback](https://github.com/GetResponse/DevZone/tree/master/Callback/README.md) is much more efficient than querying this method periodically.

        }

##OPERATORS<a name="operators"/>

There may be several types of operators in method conditions.

Text:

* `EQUALS`, `NOT_EQUALS` – Compare text literally. Case insensitive.
* `CONTAINS`, `NOT_CONTAINS` – Compare text with wild chars. Use % for any string and _ for one character. Case insensitive.

Numeric:

* `LESS`, `LESS_OR_EQUALS`, `EQUALS`, `GREATER_OR_EQUALS`, `GREATER` – Compare numbers. Use . (dot) as decimal part separator if needed.

Time:

* `FROM`, `TO`, `AT` – Compare dates in YYYY-MM-DD format.

**Warning**: Operators must be UPPERCASED.

##IDs in conditions<a name="ids"/>

In many methods IDs may be passed to conditions. Method [get_messages](#get_messages) will be used as an example of how to do it.

```json
    [
        "API_KEY",
        {
            "campaigns"     : [ "CAMPAIGN_ID", "CAMPAIGN_ID" ],
            "get_campaigns" : { get_campaigns conditions },
            ...
        }
    ]
```

Method expects a list of campaigns in conditions to narrow down search results.
Those campaigns may be given as an array of `CAMPAIGN_ID` values obtained from [get_campaigns](#get_campaigns).

```json
    [
        "API_KEY",
        {
            "campaigns" : [ "4b1b5", "b35f2b" ]
        }
    ]
```

It will return messages from those two specific campaigns.
But sometimes it is faster/easier to nest [get_campaigns](#get_campaigns) conditions in [get_messages](#get_messages) method.

```json
    [
        "API_KEY",
        {
            "get_campaigns" : { "CONTAINS" : "my_campaign_%" }
        }
    ]
```

It will return messages from campaigns that have name beginning with my_campaign_. Pretty easy, isn’t it?

**Hint**: Nesting of conditions is also legal. For example [send_newsletter](#send_newsletter) conditions may contain [get_contacts](#get_contacts) conditions which may contain [get_links](#get_links) conditions which may contain [get_messages](#get_messages) conditions which may contain [get_campaigns](#get_campaigns) conditions. Everything in one request!

**Warning**: Do not use `campaigns` when you mean `get_campaigns`. And the other way round. Condition `campaigns` expects array of `CAMPAIGN_ID` values while condition `get_campaigns` expects [get_campaigns](#get_campaigns) method conditions. Same for `messages`/`get_messages`, `contacts`/`get_contacts` and others.

**Warning**: Do not provide text where `ID` is expected. This is incorrect.

```json
    "campaigns" : [ "my_campaign_1" ]
```

##ERRORS

Field `error` format is compatible with [JSON-RPC 2.0 spec](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object).

Errors not included in spec:

* Invalid API key.

```json
    {
        "code"      : -1,
        "message"   : "API key verification failed",
    }
```

* Client IP not from trusted network (GetResponse 360 only)

```json
    {
        "code"      : -1,
        "message"   : "API client IP not allowed",
    }
```

* Method error, list of `message` values in this error is provided in method documentation.

```json
    {
        "code"      : -1,
        "message"   : "...",
    }
```
